I'm Juan, a programmer from Colombia. I specialize in building websites, and I'm a big fan of Node.js and React âš›. In addition to that, I enjoy working with various libraries and technologies to enhance my projects, particularly in the context of e-commerce in this moment. My current stack include:

Frontend: React, Tailwind, Next13, Vtex, Jest, Shopify


Backend: Node.js, Koa, Express, PostgreSQL, Jest, Swagger, Docker, Render


I'm also passionate about applying Clean Architecture for creating modular and scalable solutions, particularly for big projects.
