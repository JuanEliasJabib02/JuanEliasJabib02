<h1 align="start">Hi friend!</h1>

I'm Juan, a programmer from Colombia. I specialize in building websites, and I'm a big fan of Node.js and React âš›. In addition to that, I enjoy working with various libraries and technologies to enhance my projects, particularly in the context of e-commerce in this moment. My current stack include:

Frontend: React, Tailwind, Next13, Vtex
Backend: Node.js, Koa, Express, PostgreSQL, Docker

I'm also passionate about applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Clean Architecture for creating modular and scalable solutions, particularly for big projects.
