<h2>Mindset</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Currently i can work in any Javascript stack as Front or Back with any library just watching docs and applying to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>Most interesed on build full customs apps in modern stacks around Nextjs and a BaaS like Supabase, with this type of stack a small team can do faster robust and scalables, also with this type of stack is easier and faster to build a typed end-to-end code , high security, high performance, and high seo optimization app.
  <li> I'm in love with Medusa.js as the core for my e-commerces apps using next.js + vercel, same benefits is a modern stack, easy way to get a top quality e-commerce, just using medusa as my backend to avoid re-invest the wheel and medusa team 
is doing a great job, for my actually the better e-commerce framework.

.</li>
  <li>I love the open source , because the better techs are free and give to a lot of ppl including me the opportunity to get a better life from latam.
