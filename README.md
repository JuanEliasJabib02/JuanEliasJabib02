<h1 align="start">Hello friend👽</h1>

I'm Juan a programmer from colombia , I'm a big fan of Node.js and React and my currently stack include :



As a Linux 🐧 user, I like to make use of the command line and automate things with Bash scripts. ([1][2][3])

I have some experience with other languages as well, such as Python, Rust, Haskell, and Clojure.

Outside of programming, I teach teach music 🎼, play drums 🥁 in bands, and attempt to play guitar (at home). Peep the SoundCloud!
