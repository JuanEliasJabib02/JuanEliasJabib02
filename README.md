<h2>tech mindset</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, i can work with any JavaScript stack, front-end or back-end. I quickly learn new libraries by reading the docs and applying them to solve problems simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Interested on  building custom apps with modern stacks like Next.js and Supabase. This setup helps small teams create secure, high-performance, and SEO-friendly apps quickly and easily.
  <li>in love with Medusa.js for my e-commerce sites with Next.js + Vercel. It's like the elixir for crafting top-quality e-commerce!.
</li>
  <li>I love the open source because the better techs are free and give to a lot of ppl including me the opportunity to get a better life from latam.
</li>
  </li>
  <li>
 I'm not interested in learning new languages to accomplish the same tasks. My focus is on solving real business problems. While all languages have their strengths, I prefer JavaScript for its ability to build full-stack apps with a single syntax. It's popular and constantly evolving with new tools. I'd rather spend my time solving problems than learning another syntax for the same purpose.
